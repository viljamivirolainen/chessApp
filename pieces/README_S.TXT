                         TrueType Font: CHESS CASES

  The figures of this font belong to  the  'Cases'  font,  included  in  the
PROBLEMISTE program. This program is for solving chess problems in up to six
moves. Its author is the Frenchman  Matthieu Leschemelle,  who authorized me
to recodify the figures in order to develop a complete font. The figures are
excellent, as is PROBLEMISTE. You can find them in internet,at this address:

                     http://perso.easynet.fr/~mleschen/

  In addition, from this website you  can  download  dozens  of  files  with
thousands of problems composed by classic and modern problemists.
  
  The drawings was rexported to TTF format in Corel Draw 7.0 and recoded  in
Fontographer.  I remade the font in the  "Colegio La Salle de San Cristobal"
(La Salle School of San Cristobal), located in the pleasant mountains of the
Mayan World in the south of Mexico; in order to  expand  our  collection  of
chess fonts. The font is freeware, I hope it is useful for the chess buddies.
If you want to repay us, you can send us some other fonts for creating chess
diagrams (we are collecting them).  We will welcome any  useful  suggestions
and comments; please send them to either of address that appear below.

         CHESCASE.DOC     Sample and keymap.

  The font is installed in Windows, as in any other TTF  font.  It  will  be
helpful to you for making chess diagrams and figurine notation in  the  word
processors  which  are  run  under  Windows.  The  file  CHESCASE.DOC  which
accompanies this file is made on  Word 6.0,  and contains a  sample  of  the
creation of diagrams in a word proccesor and a keymap of this font. You will
not see these characters until the  'Chess Cases'  font is installed in your
computer.  The distribution of the figures on the keyboard is the same as in
the CHESS MARROQUIN font, as follows:

       Black king                        l                    L

* The EXTRA keys contain round corners.  The keys  (x),  (X),  (.), and  (:)
  contain auxiliary symbols to indicate individual movements of the  pieces.

NOTE: Also you find borders with the coordinates of chessboard.  For  simple
      borders, type the ASCII codes  from  0192  to  0207,  and  for  double
      borders from 0224 to 0239.  Don't forget to type [Alt]  and  the  ZERO
      which goes with each code to generate these characters.

      The figurine notation pieces are in the ASCII codes from 0162 to 0167.

      I recommend you to print the .DOC file and see the complete keymap.
